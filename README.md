# Pok&eacute;mon Friend Finder
Find your partner Pok&eacute;mon  
[View Deployed Application](https://react-poke-finder.herokuapp.com/)
## Description
This app uses Express.js and Node.js to serve an API containing JSON data with Pok&eacute;mon and a corresponding Myer's Briggs Type.  
Originally there were more html routes, but the survey page was removed in favor of a react component.  
The form finds a matching type and sends back a partner. The partner's name is sent through [Pok&eacute;Api](https://pokeapi.co/) and an image is displayed on a modal pop-up. When the results are updated, you're notified.
## Technologies Used
On the back-end, this app uses Node.js with Express.  
The front-end is made with React and Twitter Bootstrap
## Deployment
This app is deployed to heroku [here](https://react-poke-finder.herokuapp.com/).
